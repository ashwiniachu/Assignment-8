1. mins Look at the data given below. Plot the data, find the outliers and find out 

name_of_company<-c("allied_signals","bankers_trust","general_mills","ITT_industries","JP_morgan","lehman_bro",
     "marriot","MCI","merill_lynch","microsoft","morgan_stanley","sun_microsystems","travelers",
     "US_airways","warner_lambert")
name_of_company
Measure_x<-c(24.23,25.53,25.41,24.14,29.62,28.25,25.81,24.39,40.26,32.95,91.36,
            25.99,39.42,26.71,35.00)
Measure_x
df1<-data.frame(name_of_company,Measure_x)
df1
attach(df1)
plot(Measure_x,name_of_company,xlim=c(0,100))


df <- df1[order(df1$Measure_x),] # ordering the cars 
dev.off()
df1$color[df1$Measure_x > 24 & df1$Measure_x < 26] <- "red" # assigning colors
df1$color[df1$Measure_x > 26 & df1$Measure_x < 35] <- "blue" # assigning colors
df1$color[df1$Measure_x > = 35 & df1$Measure_x < 92] <- "purple" #assigning colors
dotchart(df1$Measure_x,labels=name_of_company,cex=.5, groups= df1$Measure_x,main="Company",xlab="Measure_x",color=df1$color,xlim=c(1,100))

outlier(Measure_x)

2.
Answer the following three questions based on the box-plot above.

(i) What is inter-quartile range of this dataset? (please approximate the numbers) In one line, explain what this value implies.

in this box plot ,
third quartile is 12 and first quartile is 5
hence IQR is 12-5=7
IQR=7

its a better measure of a dataset where its not affected by outliers and its the space where median is.

(ii) What can we say about the skewness of this dataset?
If the longer part of the box is to the right (or above) the median, the data is said to be skewed right.So it is skewed right.

(iii) If it was found that the data point with the value 25 is actually 2.5, how would the new box-plot be affected?

if that value is 2.5 den it contributes to first quartile.and it wouldnt be a outlier anymore.

3

Answer the following three questions based on the histogram above.
(i) Where would the mode of this dataset lie?
its between 4- 7

(ii) Comment on the skewness of the dataset.
most of the data are on the left side of the histogram but a few larger values are on the right, the data are said to be skewed to the right.

(iii) Suppose that the above histogram and the box-plot in question 2 are plotted for the same dataset. Explain how these graphs complement each other in providing information about any dataset. 

Data presentation would be visible since both are right skewed.


4. AT&T was running commercials in 1990 aimed at luring back customers who had switched to one of the other long-distance phone service providers. One such commercial shows a businessman trying to reach Phoenix and mistakenly getting Fiji, where a half-naked native on a beach responds incomprehensibly in Polynesian. When asked about this advertisement, AT&T admitted that the portrayed incident did not actually take place but added that this was an enactment of something that “could happen.” Suppose that one in 200 long-distance telephone calls is misdirected. What is the probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number? (Assume independence of attempts.)

probability that one long-distance telephone calls is misdirected p = 1/200 

probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number =

1 - probability that none of the five calls are misdirected 
= 1-(1-p)^5
= 1 - (1-1/200)^5
 0.02475125

5. Returns on a certain business venture, to the nearest $1,000, are known to follow the following probability distribution

(i) What is the most likely monetary outcome of the business venture?
	
X=2000 ,probability of 0.3(highest)

(ii) Is the venture likely to be successful? Explain
p(x=1000)+p(x=2000)+p(x=3000)=0.6
sum of non negative number is greater than 0.5 hence it will be successfull.

iii) What is the long-term average earning of business ventures of this kind? Explain


sum(xp(x)) of all

(0.1)*(-2000)+
(0.1)*(-1000)+
(0)*(0.2)+
(0.2)*(1000)+
(0.3)*(2000)+
(0.1)*(3000)
=800

average earnong of this venture is $800

(iv) What is the good measure of the risk involved in a venture of this kind? Compute this measure

Standard deviation=1469.693
